Welcome to the repository for my personal portfolio website. This website serves as a showcase of my skills, projects, experience, and provides information about me. Feel free to explore and get in touch if you have any questions or opportunities.

## About Project

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This project was meticulously crafted using Angular version 17.1.2, showcasing the latest advancements in web development technology. From its foundation to the intricate details, every aspect reflects a commitment to delivering a seamless and engaging user experience.

### Recommended Viewing

While the portfolio is designed to be responsive, I recommend viewing the [final version](https://thirudev50.github.io/portfolio/) on a laptop or desktop. This allows you to fully immerse yourself in the beauty of the 'On Hover' animations, providing a more comprehensive showcase of my skills and design philosophy.

### Technologies Used

- **Angular 17.1.2:** Leverage the power of Angular, a robust and feature-rich front-end framework, to create a seamless and dynamic user interface.

- **SCSS:** Explore the creative possibilities of SCSS, a preprocessor scripting language that is used to describe the style of a document cleanly and structurally.

- **TypeScript 5.3.2:** Enhance your development workflow with TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the language. This version, "~5.3.2," ensures compatibility with the project, bringing the benefits of strong typing and improved tooling support.

### Key Features

- **Dynamic Animations:** Elevate your browsing experience with a plethora of dynamic animations strategically implemented throughout the site. The animations, especially those triggered 'On Hover,' are meticulously designed to create an immersive and visually appealing interface.

- **Responsive Design:** The project is built with responsiveness in mind, ensuring optimal performance across various devices. Whether you're accessing it from a mobile device or a larger desktop screen, the layout adapts gracefully to provide a consistent and user-friendly experience.

- **SCSS for Styling:** Dive into the world of Scalable and Modular Stylesheets (SCSS), where every style decision is intentional. The project's stylesheets are meticulously organized and optimized, contributing to the overall maintainability and aesthetics of the site.
